Question 1
The textfile, travel_plans.txt, contains the summer travel plans for someone with some commentary. 
Find the total number of characters in the file and save to the variable num.

f = open('travel_plans.txt','r')
num = len(f.read())

We have provided a file called emotion_words.
txt that contains lines of words that describe emotions. 
Find the total number of words in the file and assign this value to the variable num_words

f = open('emotion_words.txt','r')
lines = f.readlines()
num_words = 0
for lin in lines:
    list = lin.split(' ')
    n = len(list)
    num_words += n
print(num_words)

Assign to the variable num_lines the number of lines in the file school_prompt.txt.

with open ('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as f:
    f = f.readlines()
    num_lines = len(f)

Assign the first 30 characters of school_prompt.txt as a string to the variable beginning_chars.

with open ('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as f:
    f = f.read()
    beginning_chars = f[:30]

Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, assign the third word of every line to a list called three.

three = []
with open ('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as f:
    f = f.readlines()
    for line in f:
        print(line)
        line = line.split(' ')
        a = line[2]
        three.append(a)

Challenge: Create a list called emotions that contains the first word of every line in emotion_words.txt.

emotions = []
with open ('emotion_words.txt', 'r') as f:
    f = f.readlines()
    for line in f:
        print(line)
        line = line.split(' ')
        a = line[0]
        emotions.append(a)

Assign the first 33 characters from the textfile, travel_plans.txt to the variable first_chars.

with open ('travel_plans.txt', 'r') as f:
    f = f.read()
    first_chars = f[:33]
    
Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, if the character ‘p’ is in a word, then add the word to a list called p_words.

p_words = []
with open ('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as f:
    f = f.readlines()
    for lin in f:
        a = lin.split()
        for b in a:
            if 'p' in b:
                print(b)
                p_words.append(b)

Assign the first 33 characters from the textfile, travel_plans.txt to the variable first_chars.
